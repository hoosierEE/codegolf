NB. hole 7 in J
NB. (normalized, magnitude) of a vector

NB. full solution
(([:+.@*j./);+&.*:/)

NB. explanation
NB. this whole thing is a tacit expression, which means it doesn't explicitly refer to its arguments.
NB. instead, it uses forks and hooks to implicitly route the arguments.
NB. an explicit version, referring to the right argument as Y, would look like this:
NB.

NB. since J executes right-to-left, we can start with the rightmost expression:
NB. (+&.*:/)
NB. This parses like ((+&.*:)/) so let's consider the innermost parenthesized part first.
NB. Essentially, this does sqrt(sum(square(y))), but in J this can be expressed as "sum under square",
NB. meaning, "square y, then sum, then perform the inverse of square on the result of the sum"
NB. u &. v y  is general, and J provides inverses for many of its built-in operations,
NB. and can deduce the inverse of many user-defined ones.  You're also able to override the default
NB. or provide your own inverse if necessary.
NB. Finally, we use insert (/) to put "sum under square" between the items of y
NB. for a 2-element vector, this yields the magnitude.

NB. next up is the leftmost expression
NB. ([:+.@*j./)
NB.        j./ y  uses insert (/) to put complex (j.) between the items of y
NB.       (j./ 2 3)  is the same as   (2 j. 3), and yields the complex number 2j3.
NB. From the J dictionary:
NB. *y is _1 if y is negative, 0 if it is zero, 1 if it is positive;
NB. more generally, *y is the intersection of the unit circle with the line
NB. from the origin through the argument y in the complex plane.
NB. so  (*j./ y)   is the normalized direction vector of y
NB. real (+.) takes the real component of a complex number
NB.  (+.@*j./ y) uses compose (@) to create a single verb from +. and *
NB. Finally, we use cap ([:) to keep the parser from treating this sub-expression as a hook.

NB. last, we link (;) the results of the two sub-expressions together
NB. this puts the left result (a 2-argument vector) into a "box", and the right result (an atom) into another box
NB. and puts the two boxes into an array.
NB. This is J's main way of dealing with heterogeneous data:
NB. Got 2 or more different (or different-shape) things?
NB. Put all the things into boxes, now you have a homogeneous array of boxes.
